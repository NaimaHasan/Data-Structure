// You are given an array, where each element in the array denotes the amount of time needed for that single project. 
// You will have to distribute these projects among K workers. The projects assigned to a single worker need to be consecutive. 
// What is the minimum amount of time needed to finish all the projects? 
// You should assume that K workers can work parallelly in a project. 
// A worker can work on a single project at a time.
